# Machine-learning(ML)-for-NLP
Applied different types of classification models in Scikit-Learn to determine 
which of the classification models performs better in Natural Language Processing
using the bag-of-words model(classification) for basic task in sentiment analysis.

# Machine-learning(ML)-for-forecasting
Applied different types of regression models in Scikit-Learn to determine 
which of the regression models performs better in forecasting space weather data.
