# Machine-learning-for-NLP
Applied different types of classification models in Scikit-Learn to determine 
which of the classification models performs better in Natural Language Processing
using the bag-of-words model(classification) for basic task in sentiment analysis.

# "Classification models":
1. Random Forest Classifier
2. K Nearest Neighbour classifier
3. Logistic Regression classifier
4. Naive Bayes classifier
5. Decision Tree classifier
6. Support Vector Machine classifier
